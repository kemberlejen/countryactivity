                <p>The Mint Tea Ritual is a cherished Moroccan tradition that goes beyond the simple act of drinking tea. It is a symbol of hospitality, friendship, and warmth deeply ingrained in Moroccan culture.
                    The ritual begins with the preparation of a flavorful blend of green tea leaves, fresh mint leaves, and sugar. The tea is brewed in a teapot, poured into small glasses, and then poured back into the teapot multiple times to mix the flavors and create a frothy texture.
                    This process, known as “high pouring,” is an art form in itself. The tea is then served to guests, who sip it slowly, savoring the refreshing taste and engaging in conversation.
                    The Mint Tea Ritual is a beautiful expression of Moroccan hospitality, creating a sense of connection and conviviality.</p></div>
                <div><img src="images/hammam.jpg">
                <p>The Hammam Tradition in Morocco is a centuries-old bathing ritual that is both a cleansing experience and a cherished social activity. The hammam, or public bathhouse, provides a space for people to gather, relax, and rejuvenate.
                    The ritual involves a series of steps, starting with a steam session to open the pores and cleanse the skin. This is followed by a vigorous exfoliation using a special glove called a kessa and a traditional black soap made from olives.
                    The body is thoroughly scrubbed to remove impurities and dead skin cells. Afterward, cool water is used to rinse off the soap and refresh the body.
                    The Hammam Tradition is not only a physical cleansing but also a time for relaxation, socializing, and self-care.</p></div>
